MMPReactiveStompClient is a reactive WebSocket/STOMP client library based on [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) and [SocketRocket](https://github.com/square/SocketRocket). STOMP implementation is based on [StompKit](https://github.com/mobile-web-messaging/StompKit/). 

## Installation

I will eventually make this a CocoaPods component but for now you can fork/clone it and copy *.h and *.m from /Classes directory to your project.

## Usage

This is a very early version and only implements most basic STOMP subscription and message handling.
